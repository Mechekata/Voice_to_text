# Voice to text
This program will record everything you say.
I couldn't upload the exe file right away, so here's the open source code that you can edit.
It's written in Python. You can turn it into an exe file using the auto py exe library.



# How to use
First step we need to download all libaries:                                                                                                                                                                          

`pip install SpeechRecognition`

`pip install keyboard`

_If you want sounds(on/off)_                                                                                                                                                                                          

`pip install pyglet`                                                                                                                                                                                                  

Then just run:                                                                                                                                                                                                        
_If you want with sounds:_ run VTT_n0f.py                                                                                                                                                                             
_If you want without sounds:_ run VTT.py
